#' @title Calculate a mapping from one sets of age groups to another set of age groups
#' 
#' @description Sometimes data/results are stratified in different ways. For example in the UK data set vaccination
#' is divided into age groups: <1, <5, <15, <25, <45, <65 and 65+, while virological data is 
#' provided as <5, <15, <45, <65 and 65+. This function calculates a mapping from one set of age groups
#' to another. If the age groups we want to map to is a subset of the original age groups (as in the UK)
#' then this is straightforward. If instead one or more of the from age group needs to be split over multiple to age groups
#' then the function weights the age group by the size of the population (demography).
#' 
#' @param from The upper limit to each age groups you want to map from
#' @param to The upper limit to each age groups you want to map to
#' @param demography Optional vector with the demography of the population. This value is needed if the to age groups are
#' not a subset of the from age groups. First value is the population of 0 year olds.
#' Second of 1 year olds etc...
#' @return A data frame containing which age groups map to which other age group. And what proportion (weight)
#' of the age groups maps to the other age grouping.

#' @title Calculate a mapping from one sets of risk groups to another set of risk groups

#' @description Sometimes data/results are stratified in different ways. For example in the UK data set vaccination

#' This function provides a standardised way of mapping one to another. 
#' 
#' @param from The risk groups you want to map from
#' @param to The risk groups you want to map to
#' @param weights Optional vector with the weight/fraction of how each from group should be grouped into a to group. For example if your epidemiological model
#' groups everything together, but the data is divided into two equal risk groups you would use: 
#' \code{risk_group_mapping(from = "All", to = c("R1", "R2"), weights = c(0.5, 0.5))}. The UK example uses the mapping: 
#' \code{risk_group_mapping(from = c("High risk", "Low risk", "Pregnant"), to = "All")}

#' of the risk groups maps to the other risk grouping.
